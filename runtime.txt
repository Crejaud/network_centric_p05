The first result is using fread on the entire file and storing it in a buffer.

The second result is using system calls and reading characters one by one and then storing them in a buffer.

test is a 10M file (using mkfile 10m test, in Mac, so there are no garbage values, it's all 0s).

The first result is significantly quicker because it is reading the whole file all at once, while the second result is using system calls and reading each character one at a time. Each time a character is read, there is an extra condition check and it is stored in buffer, then counter is incremented. This can cause a lot of delay, hence it is slower than fread.
